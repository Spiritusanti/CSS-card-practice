# CSS Animated Card practice
Built following tutorial from Kevin Powell @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DEq5cWNYt8

Things I learned that were new to me in this project:
1. @media(hover) & @media(prefers-reduced-motion)
2. styling for users who prefer tab navigation
3. modifying styles for user who prefer no animations
